        <div class="box-text">Photoshop:digital painting of fashion models based on a collaboration project with textile students in my third year of university. The background is a nasa photo and all animation was done on After Effects to add a VHS effect. A reversible skirt that the textile students made so I animated it as a stop motion and took it to After Effects to add a photoshopped Tv and VHS effect on top. I took a live action video of some trees in the snow and again took it to after effects and added a VHS edit to it. The entire clip was composed in Premier Pro.</div>
